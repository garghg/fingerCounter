# Hand Tracking and Finger Counting with MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project demonstrates hand tracking and finger counting using Python's MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries. The application captures video from the webcam, detects hand landmarks, counts fingers, and recognizes specific hand gestures.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `mediapipe`
- `opencv-python`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
 ```
